# Dude Up webapp

## What

A webapp to record and settle up up shared expenses (i.e. a kitty)

## Why

I went on a holiday with friends. We had a shared kitty and a run in with a scorpion. When I got home I thought it would be fun to write some code to calculate who owed what to whom.

Writing that logic (https://github.com/crosslandwa/dudeup) was fairly easy, and I realised it would be fun/an opportunity to learn/practice another (React) webapp

## Run

Run locally (via webpack devserver)
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- [Redux saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
  - I read [this article](https://blog.matters.tech/10-redux-tips-from-the-trenches-55e06ed1c0a8) and agreed with the statements about [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) (which I'd used previously)
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
